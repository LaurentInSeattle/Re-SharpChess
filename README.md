# Mini Chess
A Chess engine written in C# and a multiplatform beginner-friendly User Interface based on Avalonia to play against the computer, for Windows, Mac and Linux

# More Progress ~ Now Playable
Can now complete a game without crashing, but can only play White, for now.

Still needs a lot of love...

# Based on Minimal Chess Engine
The engine is based on Minimal Chess Engine - officially rated at 2400+ ELO points, authored by Thomas Jahn ( https://github.com/lithander ), a project completed something like 5 years ago. 
The original code has only been slightly modernised for .Net 10. (More needs to be done in this area...)
